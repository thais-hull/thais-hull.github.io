            <p>I'm a video editor based in Ontario with a deep appreciation for storytelling and the collaborative nature of filmmaking. I bring a strong sense of organization, attention to detail, and creative vision to every project. I specialize in post-production using Avid Media Composer, Adobe Creative Suite, and Maya to support projects that require 3D elements or visual effects.</p>
            <p>Beyond the editing bay, I'm passionate about travel, nature, and connecting with people from all walks of life. Drawing inspiration from stories people share and the world around us - fuels my creativity and helps shape the way I approach each project.</p>
            <p>If this approach feels right for you, reach out about your project.</p>
